## Problem Statement
With the overwhelming number of streaming services available today, finding the right movie can be time-consuming and frustrating.  

- Each platform only recommends content from its own library.  
- Movie trailers and plot summaries rarely provide enough detail to help viewers decide if a film contains themes they want to avoid.  
- Most services rely heavily on genre tags, but users often have more specific needs, such as following favorite actors across different genres or excluding specific directors or themes.  

---

## Solution
FindMyFlick provides a cross-platform recommendation system that allows users to:  

- Filter by favorite genres, actors, and directors.  
- Exclude movies containing specific themes or triggers.  
- Receive suggestions that combine multiple preferences for a customized experience.  

This solution goes beyond the limitations of single-platform algorithms, offering a broader, more satisfying movie discovery process.

## Repository Structure
- `Documents/` – Project documentation (design contracts, reports, etc.)  
- `python_scripts/` – Proof-of-concept Python scripts  
  - Demonstrates content warning lookups from external APIs  
  - Includes setup instructions, dependencies, and example outputs  

---

## Notes
- The Python scripts are **prototype code** for demonstration.  
- The final implementation may use another language (e.g., JavaScript).  
- For setup instructions, see [`python_scripts/README.md`](python_scripts/README.md).
