Basic idea behind the search system:


can do search w/o items in main search bar visually (tag only searches)


main search bar can have anything(?) typed into it and take it as an input


search system takes in input from search bar and then the include/exclude filters from other parts of UI


if nothing is found give a blank page

if tag is parent tag search for all children as well
